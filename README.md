### Hi!

If you are here exploring WuufPak, please know this is an active construction site!

WuufPak is the concept of a social media site to connect pets & pet owners.

### This project will have the following features once complete:

- Authentication
- A functioning chat
- A realistic User Feed with posts, likes, comments, and meta data.
- Individual Calendars
- GoogleMaps API and location based services
- Group features and social networking functionality.


### What you are seeing now:
- This was a static display to introduce the concept of WuufPak in mid Feb.
- For this phase I explored the features and functions of Material UI.
- I established a MongoDB strucutre with realistic schemas and sample data to display the page

### How I am moving forward:
- I want to refactor the project to Bootstrap in order to refine skills and utilize a more familiar UI framework.
- I want to refactor the DB into a SQL based database because I believe relational database structure will be better for the task of this site....I am leaning towards PostgreSQL at this time.
- Finish features described above
- Deploy to AWS and create system design for webscale traffic (horizontal scaling, NGINX, and REDIS caching)

### Please stay tuned!
